# delta-calib

Deltabot calibration using lasers

## Installation

You'll need Node.js, OpenCV, and gpio-admin on your Pi.

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-gpio) to get gpio-admin... **EXCEPT** don't clone the repo it tells you to! Clone [https://github.com/rexington/quick2wire-gpio-admin.git](https://github.com/rexington/quick2wire-gpio-admin.git) and then `git checkout fixpath` before running the build steps.
